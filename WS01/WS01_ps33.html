    <p>The red chilipepper 🌶️, a popular food product in New Mexico. What creates the heat in this pepper is the
        chemical capsaicin (C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>27</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>). When eaten, natural endorphins in the body are
        released which not only reduce the pain from the heat but create a feeling of general well-being.</p>
