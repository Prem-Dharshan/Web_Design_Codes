        <p>The <b>National flag</b> of India has three equal <em>horizontal bands</em> - the top panel is
            India saffron (Kesari), the bottom panel is India green and white middle band
            bearing at its <u class="spell-check">centre</u> the design of
            <u>Ashoka Chakra</u> in navy blue <u class="spell-check">colour</u> with 24
            equally spaced spokes. <u class="spell-check">It was adopted</u> by the Constituent Assembly on
            22<sup>nd</sup>
            July 1947, when it became the official flag of the <u>Dominion of India</u>. The flag
            was subsequently retained as that of the <mark>Republic of India</mark>. The flag is based
            on the Swaraj flag, a flag of the Indian National Congress designed by
            PingaliVenkayya.
