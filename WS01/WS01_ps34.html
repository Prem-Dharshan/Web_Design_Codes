            <p>The National flag of India has three equal horizontal bands - the top panel is India saffron (Kesari),
                the bottom panel is India green and white middle band bearing at its centre the design of Ashoka Chakra
                in navy blue colour with 24 equally spaced spokes. It was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 22nd
                July 1947, when it became the official flag of the Dominion of India. The flag was subsequently retained
                as that of the Republic of India. The flag is based on the Swaraj flag, a flag of the Indian National
                Congress designed by PingaliVenkayya.</p>
